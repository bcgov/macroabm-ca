"""Assembly of the two Personal Income Tax (PIT) pools.

This is the processing phase of PIT: it turns raw per-agent state into the two
per-individual arrays the central government's tax core consumes — Pool A, the
taxable income per individual (``build_taxable_income_pool``), and Pool B, the
non-refundable tax-credit base per individual (``build_credit_base_pool``). The
``CentralGovernment`` agent then applies fixed policy to these pools.

Because the agent only ever sees the two finished pools, extending the model
with a new income stream or tax credit means editing only this module. A new
income stream is a field on ``PitContext`` and a line in
``build_taxable_income_pool``; a new credit is a branch in
``_credit_amount``.
