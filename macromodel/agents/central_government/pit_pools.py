"""Assembly of the two Personal Income Tax (PIT) pools.

This is the *processing phase* of PIT.  It turns raw per-agent state into
the two per-individual arrays the central government's tax core consumes:

  * **Pool A** — taxable income per individual
    (:func:`build_taxable_income_pool`)
  * **Pool B** — non-refundable tax-credit *base* per individual
    (:func:`build_credit_base_pool`)

The :class:`~macromodel.agents.central_government.central_government.CentralGovernment`
agent applies fixed policy to these pools (taxable-income deductions, the
progressive bracket schedule, and valuing the credit base at the bottom
marginal rate).  Because the agent only ever sees the two finished pools,
**extending the model with a new income stream or tax credit means editing
only this module** — the agent's tax core never changes.

To add an income stream:
    1. add a field to :class:`PitContext`,
    2. add one line in :func:`build_taxable_income_pool`,
    3. populate the new field where the context is built (``country.py``).

To add a tax credit kind:
    1. add a branch in :func:`_credit_amount` for its eligibility / amount
       rule (the credit's base amount and indexing live in configuration).
