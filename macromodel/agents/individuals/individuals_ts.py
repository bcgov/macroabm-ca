"""Individual time series data management.

This module handles the creation and tracking of time series data for individuals
in the macroeconomic model. It captures:
- Income streams and distributions
- Labor market participation
- Wage expectations
- Unemployment benefits

The time series track both individual-level data and aggregate distributions
to analyze:
- Income inequality
- Labor market dynamics
- Social welfare outcomes
- Economic mobility
