"""Individual income determination and calculation.

This module implements strategies for calculating individual incomes from
various sources through:
- Employment earnings
- Social benefits
- Investment returns (firms/banks)
- Dividend income

The implementation handles:
- Income source identification
- Tax adjustments
- Inflation effects
- Activity status impacts
