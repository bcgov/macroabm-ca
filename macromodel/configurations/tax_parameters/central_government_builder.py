"""Single seam for assembling a jurisdiction's central-government tax config.

This module is the one place that builds a fully-populated
:class:`~macromodel.configurations.central_government_configuration.CentralGovernmentConfiguration`
for a real run.  It combines the two sources of tax inputs the project adds:

1. **Schedules** (multi-row, year-ranged tables) supplied as a loaded
   :class:`~macro_data.readers.taxation.TaxationReader` — the progressive bracket
   schedule, its companion non-refundable tax-credit amounts, and the dividend
   gross-up / DTC rates.  The reader is built by ``DataReaders.from_raw_data``
   from ``raw_data_path / "taxation" / "personal_income_tax"`` (mirroring the
   energy-sector readers); the builder consumes it rather than resolving paths
   itself.
2. **Scalars** (single-value assumptions) read from ``tax_parameters.yaml`` via
   :func:`apply_tax_parameters` — the dividend-integration switch, the
   small-business share, and the couple rental-income split.

The result is a configuration object the existing ``Country.from_pickled_country``
flow consumes unchanged: it reads ``pit_brackets`` (and scales the thresholds to
agent units), ``pit_tax_credits``, and the scalar fields.

Opt-in by design
----------------
Supplying a ``TaxationReader`` activates the progressive PIT schedule, which
changes government revenue relative to the upstream flat-rate behaviour.  It is
therefore *opt-in*: when no reader is supplied (taxation data absent) the base
(flat) configuration is returned unchanged, and a scenario must pass a reader to
switch BC taxation on.

Dividend integration activates on schedule presence
---------------------------------------------------
Within this opt-in path, dividend integration (the Canadian gross-up + dividend
tax credit) is switched on automatically when a dividend tax credit schedule
CSV is present: the builder loads its rates and sets
``pit_dividend_integration`` to ``True``.  When the schedule is absent the
builder leaves integration off and firm dividends keep the legacy treatment.
Schedule presence overrides the ``pit_dividend_integration`` switch in
``tax_parameters.yaml``; that YAML value governs only when no schedule is found.

Bracket units
-------------
``pit_brackets`` are returned in *per-individual* dollar units.  The scale to
agent-level units (each synthetic agent represents ``scale`` people) is applied
later in ``Country.from_pickled_country``; the builder must not pre-scale.

Tax-credit coverage
-------------------
The runtime credit pool (``pit_pools._credit_amount``) dispatches by credit
``kind`` and already implements universal, age-based, couple (Spousal Amount,
income-tested) and single-parent (Equivalent To Spouse Amount) credits, deriving
the household context per individual.  This builder therefore carries those
kinds.  Credits whose eligibility the runtime does not yet evaluate are
*skipped* and logged rather than silently applied to everyone.  The allow-list
below must stay in step with the ``kind`` branches in ``_credit_amount``: a key
is admitted here only once the runtime can apply the credit it gates.

    its jurisdiction's reader; nothing here presumes a single central government.
