"""Canada/BC-specific scalar tax parameters and their reader.

The ``tax_parameters.yaml`` file records the scalar tax parameters this project
adds on top of the upstream model, keyed by jurisdiction and tax year.  The
reader applies a block as an override onto ``CentralGovernmentConfiguration``.
Schedule data (brackets, credit amounts) is excluded -- it lives in CSVs in the
taxation directory (``raw_data_path / "taxation"``, with ``spoof_data/freda`` as
the committed fallback).
